					<h4>One show to rule them all</h4>
					When Peter Jackson first started planning The Lord Of The Rings films back in 1995, 
					he couldn’t have imagined how it would dominate his life. And now, six movies, 21 Oscars 
					and 23 years later, we’re heading back to Middle Earth for a brand new Lord of the Rings TV series.
					<br /><br />
					Amazon Studios are the lucky lot who’ve been tasked with recreating J.R.R. Tolkien’s literary 
					magic for the small screen, with the company signing a reported $250m rights contract in November 2017 
					with the author’s estate, publisher HarperCollins and New Line Cinema to produce a multi-season show for television.
					<br /><br />
					Here’s everything we know so far about the forthcoming Lord of the Rings TV series.
					<br /><br />
					
					<h4>What’s the release date for the Lord of the Rings TV series?</h4>
					While there’s been no official word yet on an expected release date, Amazon are required by the
					aforementioned $250m deal to begin production on the show within two years – so that means that
					the show will be on the way by November 2019 at least.
					<br /><br />
					
					<h4>Who’s making it?</h4>
					Amazon, Netflix and HBO had all been in talks for acquiring the rights, but in the end only one triumphed.
					<br /><br />
					Amazon Studios will produce the series in co-operation with the Tolkien Estate and Trust, book publishers HarperCollins, and New Line Cinema (a division of Warner Bros., which made the original Oscar-winning movies with Peter Jackson). The studios will allocate a reported $1bn budget for the show – the biggest in television history.
					<br /><br />
					Jackson is reportedly in talks about becoming an executive producer on the show, with the director’s attorney Peter Nelson recently helping start a dialogue between Jackson and Amazon about his possible role in producing the new series. [via The Hollywood Reporter]
					<br /><br />
					It’s interesting that the author’s estate will be so closely involved with production. In recent years, they were partly responsible for delaying Jackson’s initial idea for a set of Hobbit films directed by Guillermo Del Toro. They eventually settled the matter and the critically-reviled trilogy went ahead – but without Del Toro, who departed the project in 2010.
					<br /><br />
					But, just as An Unexpected Journey hit cinemas in 2012, the Tolkien estate sued Warner Bros., citing copyright infringement and breach of contract over video games and other digital merchandising. The $80m law suit was settled in July, but the problems left a bad taste in the mouths of everyone involved. Why would they go back into business with New Line so quickly?
					<br /><br />
					
					<h4>Is Peter Jackson going to be involved?</h4>
					This is unconfirmed, but a possibility. Lord of Rings fan site The One Ring has reported that Amazon is “actively”
					reaching out to writers, directors and showrunners to hear their pitches for the tv show – and Peter Jackson is on the
					list of those they’re contacting. He is one of many they’re in talks with; but it does mean there’s a small chance Jackson will return.
					<br /><br />
					
					<h4>How many seasons will there be?</h4>
					Amazon has committed to producing five seasons of a Lord of the Rings TV series as part of its $250 million rights deal.
					<br /><br />
					
					<h4>Any cast announcements?</h4>
					We’re not at that stage yet. But Ian McKellen, who played Gandalf in the original trilogy, has expressed interest
					in reprising his role. Asked by Graham Norton on his BBC radio show if it was going to be annoying to have another
					pointy-hatted wizard around, McKellen replied: “What do you mean, another Gandalf?”
					<br /><br />
					He added: “I haven’t said yes because I haven’t been asked. But are you suggesting that someone else is going to play it?
					Gandalf is over 7000 years old, so I’m not too old.”
					Meanwhile, actor John Rhys Davies, who played feisty dwarf Gimli, has criticised Amazon for making a series so soon after Jackson’s original.
					<br /><br />
					“It’s not about doing it better, it’s about making more money, that’s all,” Rhys-Davies told Den of Geek. 
					“If they think they can make more money, then they will.”
					<br /><br />
					Andy Serkis, who played Gollum in the movies, has said he doesn’t expect to be cast in the upcoming TV version.
					He told ScreenCrush: “It sounds incredible, but I don’t see myself being any part of it.
					<br /><br />
					“I think it’s a completely fresh, new approach to it all, so I don’t think I’d imagine myself to be anywhere near it really,” he added.
					<br /><br />
					However, Serkis’ co-star Sean Astin was more positive about the prospect of reprising his role as Samwise Gamgee.
					<br /><br />
					Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, he said: “I’ve been saying for 15 years…maybe like 12 years after Lord of the Rings came out,
					that it would get remade. And people always said, ‘Oh no, it’ll never get remade! It’s a classic! 
					They could never top it!’ And I’m like, ‘No, it’ll get remade. It’s a massive story! The characters are so beloved.”
					<br /><br />
					
					<h4>What will the plot be about?</h4>
					The script hasn’t even been assigned yet, but there’s several avenues the writers could go down. 
					We know the series will be a prequel to The Lord Of The Rings films, so that means anything prior 
					to Bilbo handing over the ring to Frodo is fair game. That leaves them with a mere few thousand years of folklore to work with…
					<br /><br />
					Astin theorised about what might be included in the future series’ plot: “The Mines of Moria are referred to a lot in Lord of the Rings.
					And I guess in The Hobbit trilogy, you spent a little bit of time with them, but the culture of the dwarves in the mines… 
					I would love to see like five hours of that.”
					<br /><br />
					It’s unlikely that Amazon will decide to invent new, non-canon characters. Instead, they could tell the story of a young Aragorn – 
					he’s already 87-years-old by the time The Fellowship Of The Ring begins. Failing that, the plot of recent novels like 
					The Children Of Hurin or Beren & Luthien could be a good starting point.
					<br /><br />
					There’s also numerous video game plots which have been hugely successful with younger fans – the multi-million selling Shadow Of Mordor is a good example.
					<br /><br />
					The point is: there are possibly hundreds of potential plot lines available for the Lord of the Rings TV series that would require few big changes.
