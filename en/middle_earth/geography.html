						Within the overall context of his legendarium, Tolkien's Middle-earth was part of his created world of Arda (which includes the Undying Lands of Aman and Eressëa, 
						removed from the rest of the physical world), which itself was part of the wider creation he called Eä.
						Aman and Middle-earth are separated from each other by the Great Sea Belegaer (analogous to the Atlantic Ocean). The western continent, Aman, was the home of the 
						Valar and the Elves called the Eldar. An uninhabited Eastern continent is also mentioned, but does not figure in the stories.

									Tolkien prepared several maps of Middle-earth and of the regions of Middle-earth where his stories took place. 
									Some were published in his lifetime, though some of the earliest maps were not published until after his death. 
									The main maps were those published in The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion, and Unfinished Tales.
									<br />
									Most of the events of the First Age took place in the subcontinent Beleriand, which was later engulfed by the ocean at
									the end of the First Age; the Blue Mountains at the right edge of the map of Beleriand are the same Blue Mountains that
									appear on the extreme left of the map of Middle-earth in the Second and Third Ages. Tolkien's map of Middle-earth, however,
									shows only a small part of the world; most of the lands of Rhûn and Harad are not shown on the map, and there are also other continents.

									In Tolkien's conception, Arda (Earth), was created specifically as "the Habitation" (Imbar or Ambar) for the Children of Ilúvatar (Elves and Men).
									It is envisaged in a flat Earth cosmology, with the sun, moon and stars revolving around it. Tolkien's sketches show a disc-like face
									for the world which looked up to the stars. However, Tolkien's legendarium addresses the spherical Earth paradigm by depicting a 
									catastrophic transition from a flat to a spherical world, in which Aman was removed "from the circles of the world".
									<br /><br />
									Middle-earth or Endor originally conformed to a largely symmetrical scheme that was marred by Melkor. The various conflicts
									with Melkor (as well as by the action of the Valar on one occasion) resulted in the shapes of the lands being distorted.
									<br /><br />
									Originally, Arda began as a single flat world and the Valar created two lamps to illuminate it, Illuin and Ormal. The Vala Aulë
									forged great towers, Helcar in the furthest north, and Ringil in the deepest south. Illuin was set upon Helcar and Ormal upon Ringil. 
									In the middle, where the light of the lamps mingled, the Valar dwelt at the island of Almaren in the midst of a Great Lake. 
									When Melkor destroyed the Lamps of the Valar, two vast inland seas (Helcar and Ringil) and two major seas (Belegaer and the Eastern Sea) 
									were created, but Almaren and its lake were destroyed.
									<br /><br />
									The Valar left Middle-earth and went to the newly formed continent of Aman in the west, where they created their home called Valinor. 
									To discourage Melkor from assailing Aman, they thrust the continent of Middle-earth to the east, thus widening Belegaer at its middle 
									and raising five major mountain ranges in Middle-earth which adopted a relatively symmetrical distribution, namely the Blue, Red, Grey,
									Yellow Mountains and the Mountains of the Wind. This act, however, ruined the symmetry of the shape of the continents and their intervening seas.
									<br /><br />
									Many centuries after Valinor was established, Melkor raised the Misty Mountains to impede the progress of the Vala Oromë as he hunted
									Melkor's beasts during the period of darkness in Middle-earth prior to the awakening of the Elves.
									<br /><br />
									Additional changes occurred when the Valar assaulted Utumno, some years after the Awakening of the Elves. The North-west of Middle-earth, 
									notably the regions west of the Blue Mountains (named Beleriand) wherein Melkor met the Valar host, was "much broken". Belegaer, 
									the sea between Middle-earth and Aman widened further, creating among other bays one which was the Bay of Balar, the confluence of Sirion.
									The highland of Dorthonion and the mountains about Hithlum were also a result of the battles.
									<br /><br />
									In the central region of Middle-earth, a Great Gulf (of Belegaer) was formed (the precursor to the later Bay of Belfalas). 
									To the far south, the Inland Sea of Ringil expanded greatly and separated the southernmost part of the continent from the mainland, 
									in effect forming the Dark Land (Hyarmenor) and the Inner Sea, linking by straits the previously separated Belegaer and Eastern Sea.

										As told in The Silmarillion, most of the events of the First Age took place in the land of Beleriand and its environs. 
										Tolkien placed within the bounds of Beleriand the hidden Elven kingdoms of Doriath, ruled by King Thingol, and Gondolin, founded by Turgon.
										Also important was the fortress of Nargothrond, founded by the elf Finrod Felagund. In the Blue Mountains to the east were the great 
										dwarf halls of Belegost and Nogrod. Beleriand was split into eastern and western sections by the great river Sirion. 
										In East Beleriand was the river Gelion with its seven tributaries, which defined the Green-elf kingdom of Ossiriand. 
										To the north of Beleriand lay the regions of Nevrast, Hithlum and Dor-lómin, and the Iron Mountains where Morgoth (Melkor) had his 
										fortress of Angband. The violent struggles during the War of Wrath between the Host of the Valar and the armies of Melkor at the
										end of the First Age brought about the destruction of Angband, and changed the shape of Middle-earth so that most of Beleriand vanished 
										under the sea.
										<br /><br />
										The Pelóri were also raised in the early First Age, along with the Enchanted Isles, to make Valinor essentially impassable save
										by the fortified Calacirya.

									In the Second and Third Ages, during which Tolkien set the events of the Akallabêth, The Hobbit, and The Lord of the Rings, 
									the Western regions of Middle-earth contained the lands of Eriador, Gondor, the Misty Mountains, and the vales of the great
									river Anduin. Eriador was bordered by the Ered Luin or Blue Mountains to the west, which bordered the sea and the Grey Havens, 
									also called Mithlond. To the east of Eriador lay the Misty Mountains, which ran from the far north to Isengard, home of the wizard Saruman,
									in the south. The Misty Mountains contained the great dwarvish hall of Khazad-dûm or Moria. Within Eriador lay originally the kingdom of Arnor,
									founded by men who had fled the destruction of Númenor. It later split into the kingdoms of Arthedain, Cardolan, and Rhudaur. 
									These kingdoms too had long since passed into history by the time of The Lord of the Rings. Eriador also contained The Shire, homeland
									of the Hobbits, and the nearby settlement of Bree. Rivendell or Imladris, the home of the Half-elven Elrond also lay in Eriador, 
									close to the western side of the Misty Mountains.
									<br /><br />
									East of the Mountains lay the land called Rhovanion and the great river Anduin. On its western side, between Anduin and the Misty Mountains,
									lay the Elvish kingdom of Lothlórien, home of the elf Galadriel, and the forest of Fangorn, home of the Ents. To the east of the Anduin lay
									the great forest of Mirkwood, (formerly Greenwood), and further east again were the Lonely Mountain or Erebor (seized from the dwarves by the
									dragon Smaug), the town of Dale, Dorwinion, and the Iron Hills. South and East of the Misty Mountains was the kingdom of Rohan, inhabited by 
									the allies of Gondor, and further south the kingdom of Gondor, founded like Arnor by men who escaped the destruction of the island of Númenor.
									East of Gondor, and surrounded by high mountains was Mordor, home of Sauron in his fortress of Barad-dûr.
									<br /><br />
									South of Gondor lay the lands of Harad and Khand, and the port of Umbar. In the far East beyond Rhovanion was the Sea of Rhûn, on the 
									eastern side of which dwelt the Easterling peoples. The inhabitants of all these lands were traditionally hostile to Gondor, and allied
									with Sauron at the time of The Lord of the Rings.
