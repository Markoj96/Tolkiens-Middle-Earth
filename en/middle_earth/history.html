						In The Silmarillion the history of Arda is divided into four great time periods, known as the Ainulindalë, the Years of the Lamps, 
						the Years of the Trees (the Valian years) and the Years of the Sun. In Middle-earth recorded history did not begin until the
						First Age and the Awakening of the Elves during the Years of the Trees - the time prior to that is simply known as the Beginning of Days.
						During the First Age the awakening of Men coincided with the first rising of the Sun and the beginning of The Years of the Sun, 
						which have lasted from the First Age, through the Second, Third and Fourth Ages to the present day.

									In Tolkien's universe, God is called Eru Ilúvatar. Tolkien created a cosmogony in which the genesis of the world was musical: 
									in the beginning, Ilúvatar created spirits named the Ainur and taught them to make music. After the Ainur had become proficient 
									in their skills, Ilúvatar commanded them to make a great music based on a theme of his own design. The most powerful Ainu, 
									Melkor (later called Morgoth or "Dark Enemy" by the Elves), disrupted the theme. In response, Ilúvatar introduced new themes that
									enhanced the music beyond the comprehension of the Ainur. The foundation of Tolkien's creation is that the movements of their song,
									and the conflict in themes between Melkor and Ilúvatar, laid the seeds of much of the history of the as-yet-unmade universe and the 
									people who were to dwell therein.
									<br /><br />
									Then Ilúvatar stopped the music and revealed its meaning to the Ainur through a vision. Moved, many of the Ainur felt a compelling
									urge to experience its events directly. Ilúvatar therefore created Eä, the universe itself, and some of the Ainur went into the universe 
									to share in its experience. But upon arriving in Eä, the Ainur found that it was shapeless because they had entered at the beginning of time.
									The Ainur undertook great labours in these unnamed "ages of the stars", in which they shaped the universe and filled it with many things far
									beyond the reach of Men

										In time, however, the Ainur formed Arda, the future abiding place of the Children of Ilúvatar: Elves and Men. 
										Melkor and his followers entered Eä as well, and they set about ruining and undoing whatever the others did. 
										The fifteen most powerful Ainur are called the Valar; Melkor was the most powerful, but Manwë was the leader. 
										Each of the Valar was attracted to a particular aspect of the world that became the focus of their powers. 
										Melkor was drawn to terrible extremes and violence — bitter cold, scorching heat, earthquakes, rendings, breakings, utter darkness,
										burning light etc. His power was so great that at first the Valar were unable to restrain him, until the Vala Tulkas 
										entered Eä and tipped the balance. Driven out by Tulkas, Melkor brooded in the darkness at the outer reaches of Arda. 
										The Valar settled in Arda to watch over it and help prepare it for the awakening of the Children.
										<br /><br />
										The Years of the Lamps began shortly after the Valar finished their labours in shaping Arda. Arda began as a single flat 
										world and the Valar created two lamps to illuminate it, Illuin and Ormal. In the middle, where the light of the lamps mingled,
										the Valar dwelt at the island of Almaren. This period, known as the "Spring of Arda", was a time when the Valar had ordered the
										World as they wished and rested upon Almaren, and Melkor lurked beyond the Walls of Night. During this time animals first appeared, 
										and forests started to grow. The Spring was interrupted when Melkor returned to Arda, and ended completely when he destroyed the Lamps
										of the Valar. Melkor's destruction of the two Lamps marked the end of the Years of the Lamps.
										<br /><br />
										The Years of the Trees began after Melkor's destruction of the two lamps, when the Valar retreated to the extreme western regions of Arda,
										where the Vala Yavanna made the Two Trees named Telperion and Laurelin to give light to their new homeland of Valinor in the land of Aman.
										The Trees illuminated Aman, leaving the rest of Arda (in what is now Middle-earth) in darkness, illuminated only by the stars.

									The First Age in Tolkien's history of Middle-earth began when the Elves awoke beside Lake Cuiviénen in the east of Endor (Middle-earth). 
									The Elves were soon approached by the Valar, who requested that they come to Aman to live beside them. Many of the Elves were persuaded 
									to undertake the Great Journey westwards towards Aman, but not all of them completed the journey (see Sundering of the Elves). The Valar
									had imprisoned Melkor, but he appeared to repent and was released on parole. He sowed great discord among the Elves and stirred up rivalry 
									between the Elven princes Fëanor and Fingolfin. He then slew their father, King Finwë, destroyed the Two Trees themselves with the aid of 
									Ungoliant the spider, and stole the Silmarils, three extraordinarily precious gems crafted by Fëanor that contained light of the Two Trees,
									from their maker's vault.
									<br /><br />
									Fëanor persuaded most of his people, the Noldor, to leave Aman in pursuit of Melkor to Beleriand, cursing him with the name Morgoth, 
									'Black Enemy'. He and his sons swore an oath to recover the Silmarils at any cost. Fëanor led the first of two groups of the Noldor. 
									The second and larger group was led by Fingolfin. The Noldor stopped at the Teleri port-city, Alqualondë, but the Teleri refused to 
									give them ships to get to Middle-earth. The first Kinslaying ensued when Fëanor and many of his followers attacked the Teleri and
									stole their ships. Fëanor's host sailed on the stolen ships, leaving Fingolfin's behind. The second group had little choice but to 
									cross over to Middle-earth through the deadly Helcaraxë (or 'Grinding Ice') in the far north. Subsequently, Fëanor was slain, but 
									most of his sons survived and founded realms, as did Fingolfin and his heirs. Meanwhile, the Valar took the last two living fruit of 
									the Two Trees and used them to create the Moon and Sun, which remained a part of Arda, but were separate from Ambar (the earthly world).
									<br /><br />
									The Years of the Sun began when the Valar made the Sun, and it rose over Ambar, and thereafter time in the First Age was counted from 
									the date of its rising. After several great battles, a Long Peace ensued for four hundred years, during which time the first Men, the 
									Edain, entered Beleriand by crossing over the Blue Mountains. When Morgoth broke the siege of Angband, one by one, the Elven kingdoms 
									fell, even the hidden city of Gondolin. The only measurable success achieved by Elves and Men came when Beren of the Edain and Lúthien,
									daughter of Thingol and Melian, retrieved a Silmaril from the crown of Morgoth. Afterward, Beren and Lúthien died, and were restored to 
									life by the Valar with the understanding that Lúthien was to become mortal and Beren should never be seen by Men again.
									<br /><br />
									Thingol quarrelled with the dwarves of Nogrod and they slew him, stealing the Silmaril. Beren waylaid the dwarves and recovered the Silmaril, 
									which he gave to Lúthien. Soon afterwards, both Beren and Lúthien died again. The Silmaril was given to their son Dior Half-elven, 
									who had restored the Kingdom of Doriath. The sons of Fëanor demanded that Dior surrender the Silmaril to them, and he refused. 
									The Fëanorians destroyed Doriath and killed Dior in the second Kinslaying, but Dior's young daughter Elwing escaped with the jewel.
									Three sons of Fëanor—Celegorm, Curufin, and Caranthir—died trying to retake the jewel.
									<br /><br />
									By the end of the age, all that remained of the free Elves and Men in Beleriand was a settlement at the mouth of the River Sirion. 
									Among them was Eärendil, who married Elwing. But the Fëanorians again demanded the Silmaril be returned to them, and after their 
									demand was rejected they resolved to take the jewel by force, leading to the third Kinslaying. Eärendil and Elwing took the Silmaril
									across the Great Sea, to beg the Valar for pardon and aid. The Valar responded. Melkor was captured, most of his works were destroyed, 
									and he was banished beyond the confines of the world into the Door of Night.
									<br /><br />
									The Silmarils were recovered at a terrible cost, as Beleriand itself was broken and began to sink under the sea. Fëanor's last remaining sons,
									Maedhros and Maglor, were ordered to return to Valinor. They proceeded to steal the Silmarils from the victorious Valar. But, as with Melkor,
									the Silmarils burned their hands and they then realized they were not meant to possess them, and that their oath was null. 
									Each of the brothers met his fate: Maedhros threw himself with the Silmaril into a chasm of fire, and Maglor threw his Silmaril into the sea. 
									Thus, one Silmaril ended in the sky, worn by Eärendil, a second in the earth, and the third in the sea.

									<div class="bg-warning text-justify">
										At the beginning of the Second Age, the Edain were given the island of Númenor toward the west of the Great Sea as their home,
										while many Elves were welcomed into the West. The Númenóreans were blessed by the Valar with long life, three times that of lesser men.
										They became great seafarers, and, in their days of glory, came to Middle-earth to teach the lesser men great skills. 
										However, the Númenóreans grew jealous of their immortal brethren, the Elves. At the height of their power, the Númenóreans ruled 
										over the Men of Middle-earth, instead of helping them. After a few centuries, Sauron, Morgoth's most powerful servant and chief captain, 
										began to organize evil creatures in the eastern lands. He persuaded Elven smiths in Eregion to create Rings of Power, and secretly forged
										the One Ring to control the other Rings. But the Elves became aware of Sauron's plan as soon as he put the One Ring on his hand, 
										and they removed their own Rings before he could master their wills. During this time, the Shadow grew over Númenor, 
										as kings no longer laid down their lives when they had lived to the fullest, but rather clung greedily to life. 
										Númenor, ever thankful to the Valar and Eru in the past, now neglected to pay tribute, growing ever more restless about the Doom of Man,
										the curse of mortality. The people of Númenor became divided between the King's Men, those who would see the power and dominion of Númenor
										grow and their gratitude towards the Elves and Valar wane, and the Faithful, who still maintained their ties with the Elves, and still 
										paid heed to the words of Eru Ilúvatar.
										<br /><br />
										With his newfound might and growing dominion over Middle-earth, Sauron claimed that he was the King of Men. Ar-Pharazôn, 
										the last king of Númenor, thinking that none but he should have this title, sailed to Middle-earth with an army to challenge
										Sauron's claim. Sauron, seeing the might of Númenor at its noontide, knew that he could not stand against them. So he allowed 
										himself to be captured and taken back to Númenor as a hostage. Soon, Sauron's deceit and fair-seeming words won him favour with the King.
										He lied to the King, and told him that Melkor, Lord of Darkness, was the true God and that Eru was but an invention of the Valar. 
										Thus began the persecution of the Faithful, who were sacrificed in the name of Melkor. Finally, as Ar-Pharazôn grew old, Sauron, 
										using the power of the One Ring, told the King that none, not even the Valar of Valinor, could challenge the might of Númenor, and that 
										the King should assail Valinor, and by setting foot on the Undying Lands, achieve immortality. Ar-Pharazôn, fearing death, assembled a 
										massive fleet and set sail for the Undying Lands. Amandil, chief of those still faithful to the Valar, remembering the embassy of Eärendil,
										set sail to seek mercy from the Valar. To disguise his intent, he sailed first to the east, and then sailed west, but was never heard from
										again. His son Elendil and grandsons Isildur and Anárion kept the Faithful out of the coming war and made preparations to flee by ship.
										<br /><br />
										Before the end of the Second Age, when the Men of Númenor rebelled against the Valar due to the deceits of Sauron, 
										Ilúvatar destroyed Númenor, separated Valinor from the rest of Arda, and formed new lands, making the world round. 
										When the King's forces landed on Aman, the Valar called for Ilúvatar to intervene. The world was changed, so that 
										Aman was removed from Imbar. From that time onward, Men could no longer find Aman, but Elves seeking passage in specially
										hallowed ships received the grace of using the Straight Road, which led from Middle-earth's seas to the seas of Aman. 
										The mighty fleet of Ar-Pharazôn and the land of Númenor, were utterly destroyed, and with it the fair body of Sauron; 
										but his spirit endured and fled back to Middle-earth. Elendil and his sons escaped to Endor and founded the realms of Gondor and Arnor.
										<br /><br />
										Sauron soon rose again, but the Elves allied with the Men to form the Last Alliance and defeated him. In a siege that lasted years,
										Gil-galad, High King of the Elves; Elendil, the ruler of Gondor and Arnor; and Anárion, son of Elendil; were slain, as was Sauron's body.
										Elendil's other son Isildur finally cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand with his father's sword, diminishing Sauron's power and making 
										his spirit flee once again, and thus achieving victory and peace for a time. But Isildur refused to destroy the One Ring in the fires of
										Mount Doom, against all advice, and took it as a weregild for his father and brother. However, the Ring soon betrayed him when it abandoned
										him during an ambush of Orcs at the Gladden Fields; Isildur was slain and the Ring was lost in the Anduin for a time.

										The Third Age saw the rise in power of the realms of Arnor and Gondor, and their decline. 
										By the time of The Lord of the Rings, Sauron had recovered much of his former strength, 
										and was seeking the One Ring. He learned that it was in the possession of a Hobbit and sent
										out the nine Ringwraiths to retrieve it. The Ring-bearer, Frodo Baggins, travelled to Rivendell,
										where it was decided that the Ring had to be destroyed in the only way possible: casting it into
										the fires of Mount Doom. Frodo set out on the quest with eight companions—the Fellowship of the Ring.
										At the last moment, he failed, but with the intervention of the creature Gollum—who was saved by the 
										pity of Frodo and Bilbo Baggins—the Ring was nevertheless destroyed. Frodo with his companion Sam Gamgee
										were hailed as heroes. Sauron was destroyed and his spirit forever dissipated.
										<br /><br />
										The end of the Third Age marked the end of the dominion of the Elves and the beginning of the dominion of Men.

									As the Fourth Age began, many of the Elves who had lingered in Middle-earth left for Valinor, never to return; 
									those who remained behind would "fade" and diminish. The Dwarves returned in large numbers to Moria and resettled it,
									though they eventually dwindled away as well. Under King Elessar of Gondor (Aragorn of the Dúnedain), peace was restored
									between Gondor and the lands to the south and east.
									<br /><br />
									In this age King Elessar bans humans from entering the Shire, allowing the Hobbits to live peaceful and unmolested lives. 
									Elessar and Queen Arwen die at almost the same time, and the kingdom is passed to his son.
									<br /><br />
									Tolkien started a story to be known as The New Shadow set several generations after King Elessar in which a new evil had arisen, 
									men playing at orcs, and which the protagonist follows one of the cultists to learn more about them, before the thirty pages of the
									draft abruptly stops. Tolkien never finished the story, as he regarded it merely as a "thriller".
