						predavao je anglosaksonski jezik (staroengleski jezik) na Oksfordskom univerzitetu. Ovo znanje mu je

									Tolkien devised Adûnaic (or Númenórean), the language spoken in Númenór, shortly after World War II, 
									and thus at about the time he completed The Lord of the Rings, but before he wrote the linguistic background 
									information of the Appendices. Adûnaic is intended as the language from which Westron (also called Adûni) is derived.
									This added a depth of historical development to the Mannish languages. Adûnaic was intended to have a "faintly Semitic flavour".
									Its development began with The Notion Club Papers (written in 1945). It is there that the most extensive sample of the language is found, 
									revealed to one of the (modern-day) protagonists, Lowdham, of that story in a visionary dream of Atlantis. 
									Its grammar is sketched in the unfinished "Lowdham's Report on the Adunaic Language".
									<br /><br />
									Tolkien remained undecided whether the language of the Men of Númenór should be derived from the original Mannish language
									(as in Adûnaic), or if it should be derived from "the Elvish Noldorin" (i.e. Quenya) instead. In The Lost Road and 
									Other Writings it is implied that the Númenóreans spoke Quenya, and that Sauron, hating all things Elvish, taught the Númenóreans
									the old Mannish tongue they themselves had forgotten.

									The Elvish language family is a group of languages related by descent from a common ancestor,
									called the proto-language. The family was constructed from c. 1910. Tolkien worked on it up to his death in 1973. 
									He constructed the grammar and vocabulary of at least fifteen languages and dialects in roughly periods:
									<br /><br />
									1910 – c.1930: Primitive Quendian the proto-language, Common Eldarin, Quenya and Goldogrin.
									<br />
									c.1935–1955: Goldogrin had significantly changed and was now Noldorin, joined by Telerin, Ilkorin, Doriathrin and the Avarin.
									<br />
									The late and mature stage dispensed with Ilkorin and Doriathrin. Noldorin matured into Sindarin.
									<br /><br />
									Although the Elvish languages Sindarin and Quenya are the most famous and the most developed of the languages that Tolkien invented for his Secondary World, they are by no means the only ones. They belong to a family of Elvish languages, that originate in Common Eldarin, the language common to all Eldar, which in turn originates in Primitive Quendian, the common root of Eldarin and Avarin languages.
									<br /><br />
									Finnish morphology (particularly its rich system of inflection) in part gave rise to Quenya. Another of Tolkien's favourites was Welsh,
									and features of Welsh phonology found their way into Sindarin. Very few words were borrowed from existing languages, so that attempts to 
									match a source to a particular Elvish word or name in works published during his lifetime are often very dubious.
									<br /><br />
									Tolkien had worked out much of the etymological background of his Elvish languages during the 1930s (collected in the form of The Etymologies).
									In 1937, he wrote the Lhammas, a linguistic treatise addressing the relationship of not just the Elvish languages, but of all languages spoken
									in Middle-earth during the First Age. The text purports to be a translation of an Elvish work, written by one Pengolodh, whose historical works
									are presented as being the main source of the narratives in the Silmarillion concerning the First Age.
									<br /><br />
									The Lhammas exists in two versions, the shorter one being called the Lammasathen.
									The main linguistic thesis in this text is that the languages of Middle-earth are all descended from the language of the Valar (the "gods"),
									Valarin, and divided into three branches:
									<br />
									<b>Oromëan</b>, named after Oromë, who taught the first Elves to speak. All languages of Elves and most languages of Men are Oromëan.
									<br />
									<b>Aulëan</b>, named after Aulë, maker of the Dwarves, is the origin of the Khuzdul language. It has had some influences on the tongues of Men.
									<br />
									<b>Melkian</b>, named after the rebellious Melkor or Morgoth, is the origin in the First Age of the many tongues used by the Orcs and other evil beings. (This tongue is unrelated to the Black Speech of Sauron.)
									<br /><br />
									Tolkien later revised this internal history to the effect that the Elves had been capable of inventing language on their own, before coming into contact with Valarin (see Primitive Quendian).

										Some samples of the language of the Dwarves, called Khuzdul, are also found in The Lord of the Rings. 
										The situation here is a little different from the "Mannish" languages: As Khuzdul was kept secret by the 
										Dwarves and never used in the presence of outsiders (not even Dwarvish given names), it was not "translated"
										by any real-life historical language, and such limited examples as there are in the text are given in the "original".
										Khuzdul was designed to have a "Semitic" affinity, with a system of triconsonantal roots and other parallels especially to Hebrew,
										just as some aspects of the Dwarves and the Jews are intentional.
