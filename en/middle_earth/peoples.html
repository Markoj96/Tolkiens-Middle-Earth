									The Ainur were angelic beings created by Ilúvatar. The cosmological myth called the Ainulindalë, or "Music of the Ainur", 
									describes how the Ainur sang for Ilúvatar, who then created Eä to give material form to their music. Many of the Ainur entered Eä,
									and the greatest of these were called the Valar. Melkor, the chief agent of evil in Eä, and later called Morgoth, was initially one
									of the Valar.
									<br /><br />
									With the Valar came lesser spirits of the Ainur, called the Maiar. Melian, the wife of the Elven King Thingol in the First Age, was a Maia. 
									There were also evil Maiar, called Umaiar, including the Balrogs and the second Dark Lord, Sauron. Sauron devised the Black Speech (Burzum) 
									for his slaves (such as Orcs) to speak. In the Third Age, a number of the Maiar were embodied and sent to Middle-earth to help the free peoples 
									to overthrow Sauron. These are the Istari (or Wise Ones, called Wizards by Men), including Gandalf, Saruman, Radagast, Alatar and Pallando.

										The Elves are known as the first born of Ilúvatar: intelligent beings created by Ilúvatar alone. 
										There are many different clans of Elves, but the main distinction is between the Calaquendi or Light Elves and
										the Moriquendi or Dark Elves. Tolkien's work The Silmarillion tells of how the Valar came to Middle-earth shortly
										after the awakening of the Elves, and invited them to come and live with them in their home in the land of Aman. 
										Those elves who accepted and began the Great Journey to Aman from their birthplace of Cuiviénen were called the 
										Eldar or the Middle-earth Eldar. The elves who completed the journey were sometimes called the Light Elves because
										they saw the magical Light of the Two Trees, the source of light in Aman. Those elves who refused the offer were called
										the Avari, and the Eldar who tired of the long journey west and remained behind in Middle-earth were called the Dark Elves 
										because they would never see the Light of the Two Trees. Generally Dark Elves were considered less powerful than Light Elves, 
										but the term 'Dark' did not imply they were in any way evil. In later years some of the Light Elves (chiefly the Noldor clan) 
										returned to Middle-earth, mainly on a quest to retrieve precious jewels called the Silmarils, stolen from them by Morgoth.
										<br /><br />
										Originally Elves all spoke the same Common Eldarin ancestral tongue, but after the long separation of thousands of years it 
										diverged into different languages. The two main Elven languages were Quenya, spoken by the Light Elves, and Sindarin, spoken 
										by the Sindar, the Dark Elves who stayed behind in Beleriand as mentioned above. Tolkien compared the use of Quenya in Middle-earth
										as like Latin, with Sindarin as the common speech. The Teleri of Valinor spoke Telerin, which was very close to Quenya but generally
										considered a distinct language and not a dialect.
										<br /><br />
										Physically the Elves resemble humans almost identically; indeed, they are arguably the same species, as they can marry and have
										children (though this is extremely rare and the Half-elven are very famous as a result). However the Elves have a more ethereal 
										and less visceral nature, and their bodies "fade" into their spirits, to the point that any Elves alive today would be totally 
										ghostlike and invisible to most Humans.
										<br /><br />
										The Elves are very agile and quick-footed. They are generally somewhat taller than Men. They are also extremely coordinated, 
										as is evident in The Fellowship of the Ring, when the elves walk across the rope in the woods of Lothlórien. Their eyesight is 
										hawk-like and they are also said to glow with light. Another example is when the Fellowship take the pass of Caradhras, 
										where Legolas of Mirkwood is able to walk across the deep snow without falling through. Though they can be killed, Elves are
										immortal, and when they reach maturity they appear to cease aging (though they do continue to physically age, just at a rate 
										so slow as to be almost imperceptible, such as in Círdan's case). They are also re-embodied in Valinor if they are slain or die
										in an accident, and in the first and second ages, had the ability to return to Middle Earth exactly as they were previously, 
										though they very seldom opted to do so. Their ears are pointed only to a slight extent.
										<br /><br />
										In Tolkien's writings the elves have been divided in several subgroups described in English as high elves, light-elves, fair-elves,
										deep elves, sea-elves, green-elves, wood-elves (sylvan elves), dark elves, grey-elves, and the special category half-elves. 
										In the languages of the Elves there are additional subgroups under the above categories.

								<div class="bg-warning text-justify">
									Men were the second born of the Children of Ilúvatar, who awoke in Middle-earth much later than the Elves and (probably) also after the Dwarves.
									In appearance they are much like Elves, but unlike them they are mortal, ageing and dying quickly (usually living 40–80 years, though the 
									Númenóreans lived several centuries), and also are on average less beautiful. The men involved in Tolkien's stories are mainly the three 
									tribes of Men who allied themselves with the Elves of Beleriand in the First Age, called the Edain. As a reward for their loyalty and suffering
									in the Wars of Beleriand, the descendants of the Edain were given the island of Númenor to be their home. But as described in the section on 
									Middle-earth's history, Númenor was eventually destroyed and a remnant of the Númenóreans established realms in the northern lands of Endor. 
									Those who remained faithful to the Valar founded the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor. They were then known as the Dúnedain. 
									Other Númenórean survivors, still devoted to evil but living far to the south, became known as the Black Númenóreans. 
									The languages spoken by Men include Adûnaic – spoken by the Númenóreans, Westron – The 'Common Speech' – represented by English, 
									and Rohirric – spoken by the Rohirrim – represented in The Lord of the Rings by Old English. In the Third Age and the beginning of the Fourth,
									the King of Gondor is Aragorn, son of Arathorn. Other notable men in The Lord of the Rings are Théoden, Éowyn, and Éomer of Rohan, and the 
									brothers Boromir and Faramir of Gondor. The term "Man" is used as a gender-neutral racial description, to distinguish humans from the other 
									human-like races of Middle-earth.
									<br /><br />
									The Dúnedain, due to their more pure Númenórean heritage, tend to live longer than regular humans. But, except in a few houses, the line 
									has weakened both by time and intermingling with the lesser peoples.
									<br /><br />	
									Beorn appears in The Hobbit as a huge man with the ability to transform into a bear. Beorn often left home for days at a time to fight 
									the enemies threatening the forest people. His origins lay in the distant past; Gandalf suspected that he and his people originally came
									from the mountains. Beorn is the ancestor of the Beornings, who live in the north at the end of the Third Age, allied with the Woodsmen 
									of Mirkwood.

										The Dwarves are said to have been created by the Vala Aulë, who offered to destroy them when Ilúvatar confronted him. 
										The seven Dwarf Fathers had no true life as created by Aulë, but were tied to his power. When Ilúvatar saw that Aulë had
										created the Dwarves in an desire to see Ilúvatar's vision fulfilled and not out of a desire for power or domination
										of Aulë's will, Ilúvatar brought true life to the seven Dwarf fathers. He forgave Aulë's transgression and adopted the 
										Dwarves as his own. His only condition was that they were not allowed to awaken before the Elves. Therefore, the Dwarves' 
										creator Aulë laid them to sleep in hidden mountain locations until the Elves awoke. These dwarves were known as the Seven 
										Fathers of the Dwarves, who (along with their mates) went on to found the seven kindreds of Dwarves when they awoke. 
										The first dwarf to awake was Durin the father of the Longbeards, the oldest and wisest kindred of the Dwarves, and the main
										focus of Tolkien's stories. Durin founded the greatest Dwarf kingdom called Khazad-dûm, later known as Moria in the Misty Mountains. 
										The Dwarves spread throughout northern Endor and each kindred founded its own kingdom. Only two other of these kingdoms are mentioned 
										by Tolkien, Nogrod and Belegost in the Ered Luin or Blue Mountains. These were the home of the Firebeards and the Broadbeams, 
										who were allies of the Elves of Beleriand against Morgoth in the First Age. The language spoken by the Dwarves is called Khuzdul, 
										and was kept largely as a secret language for their own use. The dwarves are mortal like Men, but live much longer, usually several 
										hundred years. A peculiarity of Dwarves is that both males and females are bearded, and thus appear identical to outsiders.
										<br /><br />
										The Silmarillion introduces the Petty-dwarves who were diminutive even by dwarven standards. They had been exiled from several of 
										the Dwarven houses. They were hunted by the elves, leading to their eventual extinction. They had other cultural differences 
										including that they were more unsociable, and freely gave out their Khuzdul names to outsiders.
										<br /><br />
										Of the races, Dwarves are the most resistant to corruption and influence of Morgoth and later Sauron. 
										The seven rings of Power of the dwarves did not turn them to evil, but it did amplify their greed and lust for gold. 
										The Dwarves' resistance to corruption is perhaps explained by their origin as the creations of Aulë and not being created 
										by or original children in Ilúvatar's vision. It is said that very few wilfully served the side of darkness. Of those 
										who did very little was written. Of the seven houses few fought on either side during The Last Alliance 
										at the end of the Second Age, and is known that none from the House of Durin ever fought on the side of evil. 
										During the early parts of the Third Age (or at least in legends of the previous), it is known that in some places 
										wicked dwarves had made alliances with the goblins and orcs. It is suggested by Tolkien in some of his notes 
										that of the dwarves that turned to wickedness they most likely came from the Dwarves of the far eastern mansions 
										(and perhaps some of the nearer ones) came under the Shadow of Morgoth and turned to evil. It is however unclear 
										if these refer to Dwarves beyond Iron Hills (the most eastern known stronghold of the Dwarves). Because Dwarves
										are not evil by nature, few ever served the Enemy of their own free will (though rumors of Men suggest the total was greater).

								<div class="bg-warning text-justify">
									Tolkien identified Hobbits as an offshoot of the race of Men. Another name for Hobbit is 'Halfling',
									as they were generally only half the size of Men (Men in those times usually grew to six feet (182.88cm)
									in height, and a Hobbit would be only three (91.44cm) or four (121.92cm) feet tall). In their lifestyle 
									and habits they closely resemble Men, except for their preference for living in holes underground.
									Although their origins and ancient history are not known, Tolkien implied that they settled in the 
									Vales of Anduin early in the Third Age, but after a thousand years the Hobbits began migrating west 
									over the Misty Mountains into Eriador. Eventually, many Hobbits settled in the Shire and in nearby Bree. 
									Tolkien says that there were three kinds of Hobbit: the Stoors, Fallohides and Harfoots. The hobbits who 
									appear most prominently in Tolkien's stories are Bilbo Baggins and his nephew Frodo Baggins, who each 
									have an important role in the quest to destroy the One Ring of Power forged by Sauron; another is Sméagol,
									who took the One Ring after it was found in the Anduin. Frodo is told by Gandalf that Sméagol was part of 
									a Hobbit-like riverfolk, but long possession of the ring corrupted and deformed him into the creature Gollum.
									By the time of The Lord of the Rings Hobbits had long spoken the Mannish tongue Westron, though their dialect 
									of Westron indicates that they formerly spoke a language akin to that of the Men of Rohan.
								</div>
							</div>
							
							<div class="tab-pane" id="orcs_and_trolls">
								<div class="bg-warning text-justify">
									Orcs and Trolls were evil creatures bred by Morgoth. They were not original creations but rather "mockeries" 
									of the Children of Ilúvatar and Ents, since only Ilúvatar has the ability to give conscious life to things. 
									The precise origins of Orcs and Trolls are unclear, as Tolkien considered many possibilities and frequently 
									changed his mind, leaving several inconsistent accounts. The Hobbit speaks of Goblins and Hobgoblins, and a 
									note at the beginning of most editions explains that "orc" and "goblin" are synonymous, while "hobgoblin" refers
									to orcs of larger size. Late in the Third Age, the Uruks or Uruk-hai appeared: a race of Orcs of great size and 
									strength that tolerate sunlight better than ordinary Orcs.
									<br /><br />
									Tolkien also mentions "Men-orcs" and "Orc-men"; or "half-orcs" or "goblin-men". They share some characteristics 
									with Orcs (like "slanty eyes") but are described as looking more like men. Some appear at the battle of Helm's Deep
									and in the Scouring of the Shire, where it is recalled that similar-looking men were seen earlier causing trouble in Bree.
									<br /><br />
									Trolls were made of stone. The Ent Treebeard describes them in The Lord of the Rings as "mockeries of Ents, 
									they are stupid creatures, foul mouthed and brutal". Daylight turned such "stone trolls" back into stone. 
									In "Roast Mutton" in The Hobbit, three trolls catch Bilbo and his Dwarf companions, and plan on eating them.
									but they are turned back to stone by the light of dawn before they get the chance. Tolkien also describes a 
									race of trolls bred by Sauron called the 'Olog-hai' who were larger and stronger than ordinary trolls, and
									who could endure daylight. Other varieties mentioned include cave-trolls, hill-trolls, mountain-trolls 
									(which dwarf all other troll kind), and snow-trolls. In The Hobbit, Gandalf alludes to trolls that have
									more than one head: "I am afraid trolls do behave like that, even those with only one head each." 
									Some soldiers from Far Harad are described as Half-trolls or troll-men.
								</div>
							</div>
							
							<div class="tab-pane" id="ents">
								<div class="bg-warning text-justify">
									The Ents were shepherds of trees. They were created by Ilúvatar at the request of Yavanna, 
									to protect trees from the depredations of Elves, Dwarves, and Men. When the Elves first awoke,
									they "desired to converse with all things", and taught the Ents to speak. The Ents developed their 
									own peculiar "Entish" language, which was impossible for other races to learn due to its long descriptive
									phrases for even the smallest things. Nevertheless, the Ents could learn other races' languages and were
									able to communicate with others that way. Huorns were intermediate in form between 
									Ents and trees: Ents that were "falling asleep" or trees that were becoming wildly active. 
									they bore a deep antagonism toward orcs. By the time of The Lord of the Rings the Ents were a dwindling race,
									as the Entwives had left the Ents and disappeared. In The Lord of the Rings, the Ents, led by Treebeard, 
									the oldest Ent, were instrumental in defeating Saruman by destroying his fortress of Isengard, and the Huorns destroyed his army of orcs.

							<div class="tab-pane" id="animals">
								<div class="bg-warning text-justify">
									<b>Sapient</b> animals also appear, such as the Eagles, Huan the Great Hound from Valinor and the wolf-like Wargs. 
									<br /><br />									
									<b>The Eagles</b> were created by Ilúvatar along with the Ents, and the Wargs were possibly descendants of earlier werewolves,
									but in general the origins and nature of these animals are unclear. Giant spiders such as Shelob descended from Ungoliant, 
									of unknown origin. Other sapient species include the Crebain, evil crows who become spies for Saruman, and the Ravens, 
									who brought news to the dwarves. Vampires are mentioned briefly in The Silmarillion (possibly equivalent to large bats
									who aided the Goblins and Wargs in The Hobbit). The horse-line of the Mearas of Rohan also appear to be intelligent and
									understand human speech. Beorn had a number of animal friends about his house. The Badger-folk are introduced in the Adventures
									of Tom Bombadil. They are said to live between the Barrow-downs and the Old Forest. In one story they capture Tom Bombadil.
									In another poem Bombadil speaks with several local animals: Little Bird, the willow-wren; Fisher Blue, a kingfisher, 
									Whisker-lad of the Otter-folk, and Old Swan of Elver-isle.
									<br /><br />
									<b>Stone-giants</b> appear in The Hobbit fighting one another in the valleys of the Misty Mountains. 
									No further reference is made to them in any other of Tolkien's writings. In the Hobbit, Bilbo remembers stories
									of giants and ogres, and thinks of them when trying to solve one of Gollum's riddles. Giants are mentioned 
									in passing throughout The Lord of the Rings, sometimes in poetic passages. Frodo mistakes the Argonath for giants
									before seeing that they are just statues, and both Helm's Deep and Minas Tirith were reputedly built by giants.
									<br /><br />
									In The Two Towers, when Gandalf returns, he mentions nameless things that dwelt along the path he followed under the earth,
									creatures who gnaw at the roots of the world.
									<br /><br />
									<b>Dragons (or "worms")</b> appear in several varieties, distinguished by whether they have wings and whether 
									they breathe fire (cold-drakes versus fire-drakes). The first of the fire-drakes (Urulóki in Quenya) was Glaurung the Golden,
									bred by Morgoth in Angband, and called "The Great Worm", "The Worm of Morgoth", and "The Father of Dragons". 
									Glaurung played a decisive part in the battles of Morgoth against the Elves in the First Age, and directed the defeat of Nargothrond,
									but was eventually slain by Túrin. Winged dragons first appeared in the Great Battle at the end of the First Age, 
									led by Ancalagon the Black, the mightiest of that host. In that battle he was slain by Eärendil. Gandalf avers, however, 
									that even the fire of Ancalagon was not sufficiently hot to destroy Sauron's One Ring.
									<br /><br />
									In the Third Age lived <b>Scatha the Worm</b>, "the great dragon of the Ered Mithrin" or Grey Mountains, 
									He owned a large hoard of dwarf-treasure, but was killed by Fram of the Éothéod in the North not long after 
									the dwarves were driven from Moria. The dwarves demanded their treasure back, but Fram gave them only a 
									necklace made of Scatha's teeth. Subsequently, many dwarves settled in the Grey Mountains; but dragons 
									multiplied there, and a great cold-drake killed Dain I (whereupon his heir Thrór, Thorin's grandfather, 
									returned to re-establish the Kingdom Under the Mountain at Erebor). That kingdom was shortly afterwards
									destroyed by Smaug, a flying fire-drake, who was later killed by Bard the Bowman in The Hobbit. 
									The Hobbit also refers in passing to "Were-worms in the Last Desert" (in the "East of East"), and to stone dragons.
									<br /><br />
									<b>Mewlips</b> are legendary creatures mentioned in The Adventures of Tom Bombadil. 
									They said to live in a fortress beyond Merlock Mountains and the Marsh of Tode 
									(though it is not clear if these are actual places). They capture their victims and 
									drag them down into the fortress to feast upon.
									<br /><br />
									<b>Turtle-fish</b> are a race of giant sea turtles mentioned in The Adventures of Tom Bombadil.
									Fastitocalon, the last of the Turtle-fish, emulates an island, waiting for people to land on his back. 
									Then he turns over, sending them to their deaths in the sea.
